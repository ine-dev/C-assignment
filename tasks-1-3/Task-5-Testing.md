1 Design a test to verify that the hexdump is working correctly. Your test must: 

 - output the results of your test to a text ﬁle 
  **Done**
  You must run your test with the following inputs: 
- ONE text ﬁle that is larger than 400 bytes and smaller than 4KB 
  **Done**
- ONE binary ﬁle such as an image or sound ﬁle that is larger than 400 bytes and smaller than 4KB 
  **Done**

2. Analyse the output from each test and explain how you veriﬁed the correctness of the results for each ﬁle tested (150 - 200 words per ﬁle tested).
 
 ##Answer-2##

 **Text File Test:**

 Text file choosen for test is test-C1-text.txt which is generated by copy and paste from web page.

 The size of initial file is 849 bytes checked by 
 
 '''
 'ls -alh' command
 '''
 
 The test was performed by 
 
 '''
 ./hexdump test-C1-text.txt 
 ./hexdump test-C1-text.txt > textOutput.txt
 '''
 
 The result of ./hexdump test-C1-text.txt shows the byte length 00000351 (0x351) which is 849 checked by
 
 '''
 python -c 'print int(0x351)'
 '''
 
 Based on the test of the size for the initial text file and the result of the hexdump program show the same size of 849 bytes.

 Also checking the location of 0x23 (value 0x20) is asci code for space and the 36th character of initial test file is space.

 Also test with pre installed hd command and the result is identical as hexdump program.

 Based on the above test, the hexdump program works for text file. Please check the output file of *textOutput.txt*.

 **Binary file Test:**

 Binary file choosen for test is test-C1-binary.png which is copied and downloaded from web page.

 The size of initial file is 606 bytes checked by 
 
 '''
 'ls -alh' command
 '''
 
 The test was performed by 
 
 '''
 ./hexdump test-C1-binary.png 
 ./hexdump test-C1-binary.png > binaryOutput.txt
 '''
 
 The result of ./hexdump test-C1-binary.png shows the byte length 0000025e (0x25e) which is 606 checked by
 
 '''
 python -c 'print int(0x25e)'
 '''
 Based on the test of the size for the initial binary file and the result of the hexdump program show the same file size.

 Also test with hd program is carried as following:
 
 '''
 hd test-C1-binary.png
 '''

 The test shows the identical result as hexdump program and end at 0000025d (0x25d) position. For further test, I chose the random positions for hd and hexdump result as following:

 position   hd   hexdump
 00000140   32     32   
 00000141   ee     ee
 00000142   b6     b6
 000001c0   38     38
 000001c1   98     98
 000001c2   77     77

 For random value check, the selected positions for both results show the same value. 

 Forture test is performed with another png file of size 47.4kb (47442 bytes).
 
 '''
 hexdump test-C1-binary2.png
 hd test-C!-binary2.png
 '''

 The test ends at position of 0000b951 for both test and the file size is 47442 bytes checked by following: 
 
 '''
 python -c 'print int(0xb952)'
 '''
 
 This test also shows the same file size checked by 'ls -al'. As conclusion, hexdump program works for  binary files. Please check the output file of *binaryOutput.txt*.
